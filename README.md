# Requirements
SDL2 (See the [SDL2](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2) setup requirements from the `go-sdl` bindings repository)


## Windows
Add a blurb about how I setup WSL2, installed SDL2 through apt get and copied the SDL2 dependencies into the /usr directory where it was all installed, 
a lot of that can be found on the SDL2 go bindings prerequisites. 

Additionally, I had to install MiNGW for windows compilation, this is why the makefile references `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc`
